## Tabletop TV

[hinjodragonfly](https://github.com/hinjodragonfly) has created a case for a television that sits on the tabletop. There is a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) in the case running dungeon-revealer and presenting the player view on the screen. The DM page is accessed with a tablet.

## Tabletop Simulator Mod

[azzco](https://github.com/azzco) has made a [Tabletop Simulator mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2164161399) that projects the player view onto the table background. Players can also view the map through the in-game tablets.
