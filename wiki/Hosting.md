## Self-Hosting

### Local Network

Local network connection is currently the default assumption of these docs.

### Remote Access

In order to allow players and even other DMs to remotely access to your installation, you need to enable additional outside services. The easiest two approaches to this are either using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), or a combination of Dynamic DNS (DDNS) and local port forwarding:

* **VPN:** Many modern routers feature built-in VPN configuration. See your router's docs for more details.
* **DDNS:** A number of [free and paid online DDNS services](https://www.google.com/search?q=dynamic+dns&oq=dynamic+dns) exist that can forward a custom hostname to your home internet network. Using port forwarding (see your router's docs) it's easy to then forward a remote port to the host port of your Dungeon Revealer installation.
